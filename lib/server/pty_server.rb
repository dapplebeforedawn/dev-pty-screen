  # WTH? -- Let me 'splain:
  # There a difference between the mode that PTY
  # starts the terminal in, and the mode that terminal
  # running the server is in.
  #
  # This means the cursor moves around the screen on the server
  # when you press the arrow keys, but when they are transmitted
  # through the PTY to vim, the escape encoding is different,
  # this results in vim just honking at you and not moving the cursor.
  #
  # By running `tput rmkx` from vim we are setting the PTY to
  # cursor mode, and ta-dah, the arrows work again.
  #
  # We have to go through vim, because there's no instance of the
  # PTY to talk to (PTY has only class methods) and there's no
  # running shell on the PTY to send commands to directly, so
  # we have to use vim's `!` to run `tput`.

  #
  # Also, just for fun, in your terminal, pressing "ctrl+v" followed by
  # any key will print the key codes, instead of running them.  Try it
  # with the enter/return key, you'll see that it's equal to `^m`.  Now type
  # a command and instead of hitting `enter`, press "ctrl+m".  Works just the same.
  # That is just too cool.
